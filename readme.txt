== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What's the difference between Time-Limited and One-Time Offers? =

Time-Limited Offers: Set your visitors access to expire after certain amount of time and redirect them to a different URL with a higher price, different offer or even a “sold out” page . You can set their access to expire after days, hours, minutes or  seconds. Works for both WP posts and pages.

One-Time Offers: One-time-offers are a method for increasing sales by offering visitors only one chance to buy a product (or to buy it at the current low price), or lose out. If they leave the page or refresh their browser, they never see the offer again and if they attempt to return they are redirected to an ‘offer declined’ page that you specify.

= How visitors gets expired?

For Page Expiration Robot to work, it needs to remember visitor actions between visits. There are 2 ways it can do this...

1) Create Perpetual Expiration (Cookie / IP): Each visitor has their own counter that starts when they first arrive at the page and the time of their arrival and can be tracked by Cookie or IP.  For example, the cookie method identifies the Internet browser they are in. The IP method is considered more secure because it identifies the machine, which can massively boost conversions.

2) Fixed Scheduling for All Visitors: You can specify when a page will stop being available for all visitors and where to send people who try to access it after that date and time. For example, you can send visitors who arrive at the page prior to the launch to a page showing a countdown to the launch. Once the launch has ended, visitors can be sent to a page with a waiting list form or different offer.
